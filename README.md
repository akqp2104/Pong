## 🎨 About the Project
This Pong clone was made as a personal side project to learn Unity basics—game objects, input handling, simple physics, UI design, and coding in C#. 
The added customization options provided extra practice with UI and gameplay logic in Unity. 
Visuals are intentionally simple to stay focused on making the game logic solid.

There is no commercial intent; this is a learning and experimentation project.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open with Unity (2021 or newer recommended).
3. Start the main scene to play.
